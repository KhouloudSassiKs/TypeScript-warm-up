# TypeScript Warm-Up Exercises

This repository provides a beginner-friendly, step-by-step warm-up for core TypeScript concepts. The exercises are inspired by CodeSignal challenges, updated and modified to reflect my own work. The goal is to help new learners build confidence through simple, clear, and practical examples while practicing typed JavaScript with TypeScript.
